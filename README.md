# Chocolate-Cornet
It isn't really about chocolate cornets.. Though I hope it was that.. Anyhow. This is to automate the printing of our index card tablature stuff. 

# Purpose

Because we play the ukulele, but memorizing tablature is hard.. Well, for special snowflakes that doesn't utilize the standard tuning of 'gcea'. Screw you baritone bastrds!11!


hey bastard artzwhicherver, sinece you're the bloody client, you also write the specifications. Hmpgh!
